## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
Before submitting your first pull request, you must [sign the sign the individual Contributor License Agreement](https://docs.google.com/a/kaazing.com/forms/d/1zdORRzO4bDAPqXN1iD1HZ-jtD71I1K21D5Dktcv1n8k/viewform).

This only has to be done once as it covers all of our GitHub repositories. It's quick and easy, and should only take you a minute. The CLA is based on [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement v2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/).

## How to submit a pull request

All changes must come through a pull request from a forked repository. Submit pull requests to the `develop` branch, as we are fans of the git flow workflow model.

Make sure that your branch builds successfully prior to issuing a pull request. This ensures that all the tests passed, the code is formatted correctly, etc.
