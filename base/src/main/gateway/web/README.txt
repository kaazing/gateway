The default gateway-config.xml includes a directory service, which serves requests to "/" (for example, http://localhost:8000/) from the "base" directory located next to this README.txt file. To ensure your files will be properly served by the directory service, place them in the "base" directory. You are free to configure the "base" directory contents as you desire.

If you have installed the "Documentation + Demos" package or have downloaded the "Gateway + Documentation + Demos" installation bundle, you will see an "extras" directory next to the "base" directory. You are free to copy files (for example, the "extras/samples" directories) from the "extras" directory into "base." Note that the "extras" directory and its contents are read-only, and may be replaced or modified if the product is patched or upgraded.
