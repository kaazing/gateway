| 1 | Stop the Gateway or Gateway cluster if currently running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [Setting Up the Gateway](../about/setup-guide.md) for instructions on how to stop the Gateway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2 | Back up any existing user-modified files (such as the Gateway configuration file, the **log4j-config.xml**, the keystore file, license file, and so on).                                                                                                                                                                                   | See the [KAAZING Glossary](../kaazing-glossary.md) for a brief reference to the various Gateway directories and locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3 | Copy your current (old) Gateway configuration file to the new Gateway installation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Copy the Gateway configuration file from your old configuration (for example. gateway-config.xml) to the `*GATEWAY_HOME*/conf` directory in the new Gateway installation. Note: If this is a Gateway cluster, then perform this step on all cluster members before proceeding to the next step. See [Clustering and Load Balancing Migration](./high-availability/u_high_availability.md#clustering-and-load-balancing-migration).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4 | If you modified any files (other than the Gateway configuration file) in the old Gateway configuration, then edit those same files in the new Gateway installation to apply your modifications. Note: Do not edit the Gateway configuration file now because it will be updated automatically when you start the Gateway in the next step. | Except for the Gateway configuration file, you must manually edit files in the new configuration to make the same customizations you made in the old configuration. For example, modified files might include the `log4j-config.xml`, `jaas-config.xml`, the keystore file, the license file, and so on. For help with the log4j-config.xml file, see [Configure Logging for an Embedded Gateway](../embedded/p_embedded_gateway_logging.md). For information about keystores and truststores, see [Secure the Gateway Using Trusted Certificates](../security/p_tls_trusted.md). Note: If this is a Gateway cluster, then perform this step on all cluster members before proceeding to the next step.                                                                                                        |
| 5 | Start the new Gateway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | When the Gateway starts it uses the old configuration file that you copied to the new GATEWAY_HOME installation. If the Gateway configuration file contains out-of-date configuration elements or namespace declaration, then the Gateway automatically updates the configuration information in memory and writes a modified configuration file to disk and appends a .new extension (for example, gateway-config.xml.new). See [About Gateway Configuration](../admin-reference/c_configure_gateway_concepts.md) to learn more about the **.new** configuration file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6 | Stop the new Gateway and replace the Gateway configuration file, if necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | If a .new configuration file was generated when you started the Gateway, then delete the current (old) configuration file and rename the .new configuration file to gateway-config.xml) so that the Gateway uses the up-to-date configuration the next time it starts. This is also a good time to make other modifications, if any, to the configuration file. For example, if you are running a Gateway cluster you should update the cluster configuration with the changes suggested in [Clustering and Load Balancing Migration](../high-availability/u_high_availability.md#clustering-and-load-balancing-migration). See also [About Gateway Configuration](../admin-reference/c_configure_gateway_concepts.md) to learn how to ensure the elements used in your configuration match what is supported by the namespace. |
| 7 | Start the Gateway or Gateway cluster and check the version number on the start log or use Command Center to check that you are using the new version.                                                                                                                                                                                      | See [Setting Up the Gateway](../about/setup-guide.md) for starting instructions. [Monitor the Gateway](../management/o_monitor.md) to learn about monitoring with Command Center. Note: Upgrade all members of the Gateway cluster before you migrate any clients. See [Clustering and Load Balancing Migration](../high-availability/u_high_availability.md#clustering-and-load-balancing-migration).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 8 | Complete the upgrade instructions in [Upgrade the Gateway](../upgrade/o_upgrade.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Return to [Upgrade the Gateway](../upgrade/o_upgrade.md) and follow the steps to to verify the configuration, migrate clients, and any other remaining migration work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
