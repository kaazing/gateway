 * {@link IoSession} provides user-defined attributes.  User-defined attributes
 * are application-specific data which are associated with a session.
 * It often contains objects that represents the state of a higher-level protocol

 * <p/>
 * <h3>Adjusting Transport Type Specific Properties</h3>
 * <p/>

 * <h3>Thread Safety</h3>

 * more than one {@link #write(Object)} calls at the same time will
 * cause the {@link IoFilter#filterWrite(IoFilter.NextFilter,IoSession,WriteRequest)}
 * to be executed simultaneously, and therefore you have to make sure the
 * {@link IoFilter} implementations you're using are thread-safe, too.
 * </p>

 * <h3>Equality of Sessions</h3>
 * TODO : The getId() method is totally wrong. We can't base
 * a method which is designed to create a unique ID on the hashCode method.
 * {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()} shall not be overriden
