In-VM pipe support which removes the overhead of local loopback communication.

<h1>What is 'in-VM pipe'?</h1>
<p>
    In-VM pipe is a direct event forwarding mechanism between two
	<a href="../ProtocolHandler.html"><code>ProtocolHandler</code></a>s in the
    same Java Virtual Machine.  Using in-VM pipe, you can remove the overhead
    of encoding and decoding which is caused uselessly by local loopback
    network communication.  Here are some useful situations possible:
    <ul>
        <li>SMTP server and SPAM filtering server,</li>
        <li>web server and Servlet/JSP container.</li>
    </ul>
