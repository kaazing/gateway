<!-- OPEN ISSUES: 2008-08-12 - duplicate entries in the lib/ directory. This 
	is a Maven bug filed here: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MASSEMBLY-285. 
	A work-around might be to use the assembly plugin to create an assembly directory 
	only, and add an antrun to make the final tarballs. 2008-08-12 - I'm not 
	convinced that the xrefs should be includes under docs, as the sources are 
	available under src/ anyway. 2008-08-12 - The assembly plugin supports filtering 
	line endings to unix/win32 style. May want to pull the zip and tar.* distributions 
	into two separate release.xml files and use this feature. -->
