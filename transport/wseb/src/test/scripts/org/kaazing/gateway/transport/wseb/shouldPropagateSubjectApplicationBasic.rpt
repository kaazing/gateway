##################################################################################################
## This script reflects Kaazing 4.0 JavaScript client running in IE11 doing emulated WebSocket
##################################################################################################
## Scenario is: connect with Application Basic auth (extended handshake), send a message, 
## expect to receive the text "OK"
# Script was generated using robot.tcpdump.converter against jms service then tweaked slightly to send Hi
# and receive OK response instead of sending BUMP connect and disconnect

# Conversation 1: create, first upstream request and downstream
# -------------------------------------------------------------
