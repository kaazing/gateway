# Autobahn test case 5.20

# Case Description
# Same as Case 5.19, but send all frames with SYNC = True. 
# Note, this does not change the octets sent in any way, only how the stream is chopped up on the wire.

# Case Expectation
# Same as Case 5.19. Implementations must be agnostic to how octet stream is chopped up on wire (must be TCP clean).
