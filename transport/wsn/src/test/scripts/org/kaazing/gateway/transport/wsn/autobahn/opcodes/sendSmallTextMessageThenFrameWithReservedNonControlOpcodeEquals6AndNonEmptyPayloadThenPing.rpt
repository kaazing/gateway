# Autobahn test case 4.1.4

# Case Description
# Send small text message, then send frame with reserved non-control Opcode = 6 and non-empty payload, then send Ping.

# Case Expectation
# Echo for first message is received, but then connection is failed immediately, since reserved opcode frame is used. A Pong is not received.
