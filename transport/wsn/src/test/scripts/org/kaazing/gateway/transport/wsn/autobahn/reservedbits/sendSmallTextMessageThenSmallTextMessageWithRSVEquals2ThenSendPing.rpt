# Autobahn test case 3.2

# Case Description
# Send small text message, then send again with RSV = 2, then send Ping.

# Echo for first message is received, but then connection is failed immediately, since RSV must be 0, 
# when no extension defining RSV meaning has been negoiated. The Pong is not received.
