# Autobahn test case 3.4

# Case Description
# Send small text message, then send again with RSV = 4, then send Ping. Octets are sent in octet-wise chops.

# Case Expectation
# Echo for first message is received, but then connection is failed immediately, since RSV must be 0, 
# when no extension defining RSV meaning has been negoiated. The Pong is not received.
