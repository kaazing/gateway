# Autobahn test case 6.4.3

# Case Description
# Same as Case 6.4.1, but we send message not in 3 frames, but in 3 chops of the same message frame. 
# MESSAGE PARTS:
# PART1 = cebae1bdb9cf83cebcceb5
# PART2 = f4908080
# PART3 = 656469746564

# Case Expectation
# The first chop is accepted, we expect to timeout on the first wait. 
# The 2nd chop should be rejected immediately (fail fast on UTF-8). 
# If we timeout, we expect the connection is failed at least then, since the complete message payload is not valid UTF-8.
