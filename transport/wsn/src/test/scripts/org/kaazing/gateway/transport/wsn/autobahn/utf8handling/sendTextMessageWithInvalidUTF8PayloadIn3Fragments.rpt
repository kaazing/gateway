# Autobahn test case 6.4.1

# Case Description
# Send invalid UTF-8 text message in 3 fragments (frames). 
# First frame payload is valid, then wait, then 2nd frame which contains the payload making the sequence invalid, then wait, then 3rd frame with rest. 
# Note that PART1 and PART3 are valid UTF-8 in themselves, PART2 is a 0x110000 encoded as in the UTF-8 integer encoding scheme, but the codepoint is invalid (out of range). 
# MESSAGE PARTS:
# PART1 = cebae1bdb9cf83cebcceb5
# PART2 = f4908080
# PART3 = 656469746564

# Case Expectation
# The first frame is accepted, we expect to timeout on the first wait. 
# The 2nd frame should be rejected immediately (fail fast on UTF-8). 
# If we timeout, we expect the connection is failed at least then, since the complete message payload is not valid UTF-8.
